{"archived":true,"author":"Jendemonium","body":"I am trying to trace my paternal side as far back as possible, starting with my great-great-great grandfather.  Josiah P Curby was born 4 April 1827 (possibly in Pennsylvania) and died 26 July 1915 in Ohio. He is buried in Hartwood Cemetery in Tuscarawas County, Ohio. He married Jane Woodward(Woodard) in July of 1849 in Tuscarawas County. Census documents list his name as both Kirby and Curby depending on the year, but his place of birth and parents' place of birth is consistently listed as PA.   \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe first record that lists him is the 1850 census, but that's the earliest information I can find (understandably, due to his date of birth and information contained on earlier census records).  I don't have a parent name or place of birth, and all attempts to dig through PA's records have been fruitless. I've tried expanding my search to look for other Curbys listed on census records in his general area, but there are none that fit what I know about him. I've got a paid account with Ancestry.com and NewspaperArchive.com, but neither have yielded any clues to find out who Josiah's parents were.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAny ideas on where to go from here?  This was very important to my grandfather, who passed away in 2002.  I've taken up the search as a labor of love, but I have exhausted every avenue I can think of.

It's not obvious to me that the degree of Java interop offered by Clojure and Scala can be maintained with the trampolining approach of Kawa. Even if it can be, you still take a performance hit.\n\n&gt; Last I looked, Scala's type inference failed on the factorial function.\n\nSo? Most Haskell developers put signatures on all top level functions and the compiler warns you if you don't (if you have -Wall on as you should). No one seems to complain about this. I can't say I spend more than 0.1% of my total programming and design time writing such things down. If anything, it saves time because it makes reading other people's code easier and it allows the compiler to give better type error messages. Having to write such signatures would not influence my choice of language whatsoever.\n\nAnd again, it's not as if it failed because it's bad. It \"failed\" because many of the type system features in Scala greatly complicate type inference -- it's undecidable in the general case. Rather than infer non-prinicipal types or other potentially confusing things, Scala requires signatures on function parameters. This seems like a reasonable compromise to me.

Of the 40 time zones on land, most are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTC−12 to UTC+14), but a few are offset by 30 or 45 minutes from a nearby hourly zone. In addition to land time zones, there are 25 nautical time zones, all separated by lines of longitude. Most (UTC−11 to UTC+11) are 15° of longitude wide, which is one hour of Earth's rotation relative to the Sun, but an hourly zone in the central Pacific Ocean is split into two 7.5° wide zones (UTC±12) by the 180th meridian, part of which coincides with the International Date Line. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west relative to the corresponding nautical time zones.

You might as well say that O'Caml can infer parametric polymorphism in a thread about Agda. Yes, it's true, but it's not helping anyone.

I'm sure he's well aware of how to do structurally-typed records. This is *very* basic stuff. Odersky was *clearly* talking about nominal subtyping and subsumption and I'm sure you know that. That is, after all, what people typically mean when talking about subtyping; it's what popular languages like Java do, it's what F&lt;: is all about, et cetera.\n\nOCaml does not do nominal subtyping.  If you want to distinguish between nominal and structural subtyping, great. You *should* do this when making claims about subtyping in OCaml in the context of Scala. \n\nHowever, you didn't; that's misleading. Someone not terribly informed would read your comment and likely get the wrong impression that OCaml's system was somehow related to Scala's and that they had somehow solved the same problem.

{"archived":true,"author":"hseldon10","body":"It is a tragedy of the commons is about the depletion of [public goods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) (or, if you prefer, a \"shared, limited resource\") through \"rational\" (which is the classical economist's way of saying \"selfish\") overuse or misuse of them.\n\nIf you think about it, hotels are not public goods; they are private property. The review sites are also not public goods. For a good to be \"public\" it needs to be non-rival and non-excludable. So, in a sense, the information collected by the review websites can be considered a public good. When the public good is processed by the private software algorithm of the review website company, it produces new information (which is also non-excludable in its access and it doesn't rival existing information). In that sense, the information provided by the website could also be considered a public good. (Just to answer this question in case somebody asks. If everything the website offers is a public good, then how does it make money? They make it through advertising. Advertising space is NOT a public good).\n\nIf the users of the website provide false or otherwise incorrect information for selfish gain, the public good will be \"depleted\" in the sense that it will lose its value. In this sense, it is a \"tragedy of the commons\" case. The fact that, by losing value, the website also loses the ability to profit through advertising sales is coincidental, and thus, does not invalidate this case as a \"tragedy of the commons\".\n\nSo, what is the solution? One solution is to privatize access to information (by charging a fee for use). Another solution would be to improve the algorithm, either by enriching the information gathering or by refining its process. In any case, regulation and/or privatization will solve the \"tragedy\" in this case, which also parallels the solutions for most instances of the tragedy of the commons elsewhere.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1317363400","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c2nq4kj","link_id":"t3_kw50d","name":"t1_c2nq4kj","parent_id":"t1_c2nq0pn","retrieved_on":1427666775,"score":11,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"xkcd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0z","ups":11,"month":9}

{"archived":true,"author":"DarkColdFusion","body":"But some people have higher value on their time. Plus I see people go out of there way to save 10 cents a gallon and it never has made sense to me.\n\nMost cars I've seen have no greater then 14 gallons (SUV's and trucks are an exception but they get worse mileage). Most people in my experience fill up at **1/4th** a tank. Most cars probably are averaging *15* mph in a city, and most cars are getting under **20 mpg** in the city.\n\nSo to go one way I would expect that it would be **2.5** miles to go that extra 10 minutes. (More miles is worse)\n\n**2.5** of **20mpg** is **.125 gallons** used. My gas around here is about *4* bucks (Maybe it's cheaper for you) so at **3.90** it's costing me about **49 cents**.\n\nSo in filling up 10 minutes away probably saves me about **$1.05** which is suggested in the comic. I've spent probably **49 cents** to get there. If I have to drive back or some similar situation I've now doubled that. I've spent 10 minutes to save less then **10 cents**.\n\nNow you can do your own numbers, but honestly I'd rather waste 50 cents and not be on the road that much longer.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1315978757","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c2jr4f9","link_id":"t3_kezzi","name":"t1_c2jr4f9","parent_id":"t1_c2jqxlc","retrieved_on":1427598047,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"xkcd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0z","ups":10,"month":9}

Two people starting at the equator at different longitudes and travelling in straight lines that are initially going north will meet at the north pole.

The type of software you use is really a matter of taste and the purpose you want it to serve. I personally use the Legacy family tree software (similar to rootmagic) but I like to keep all of my files/resources/pictures/documents in digital storage. Some people prefer to use hard copies/binders/filing cabinets. If you are one of those people geni.com will work perfectly fine as a reference tree. Something you can look at to remember what great-great grandma's father was named.  \n\nSince you don't have any living relatives or heirlooms another piece of advice I would give you is to start making these memories for future generations. I went out and bought a journal, googled \"genealogy interview questions\" and started answering those questions about myself. You should get your siblings to do the same. Who knows, maybe a great-great grand niece will stumble upon it someday and be so excited to have a real journal written by her ancestor. \n\nAlso, since you don't have living relatives to fill in some of the stories that make a family history come alive, you should really focus in on newspapers and other documents that might give you a glimpse into what life for your ancestors may have been like. I know I mentioned that before, but in your case I think it would be even more crucial. Search for the genweb associated with the state your ancestors came from (I'm assuming your in the US. Ignore this if I'm wrong) They often have links to online transcriptions of census records, newspaper articles, obituaries, etc. and they are free.

{"archived":true,"author":"[deleted]","body":"Links are cases where you have multiple pointers to the same file (or directory).  Hard links are literally \"just another file name\".  i.e. a normal file has an entry in a directory, and that entry points to an inode that actually contains a file or directory.  Links create another filename.\n\nOn Unix systems, you can create multiple filenames for a given file by doing **ln source target** -- this calls the **link()** function, to create a new entry in the directory ('target') to the file pointed at by the first argument ('source').  \n\nThis is *literally* having two names for the same file (the links are not \"second class\" filenames -- once created, they are not distinguishable from the original filename -- you just now have multiple filenames for a given physical file).\n\nObviously, hard links aren't able to cross file systems, and they are only allowed (as enforced by the OS) to be done for regular files -- you can intuit how big of a mess you could make with hard linking directories. \n\n(You can also create *symbolic* links -- these are usually considered \"normal\" links these days.  They are really just a textual string stored in a special kind of file, and whenever the file is opened, the system reads the string, and dereferences it to whatever that symbolic link goes to.  These can point to anything.) \n\nSo what Randall is getting at here is that the person was hard linking directories, and would have to have modified something at the OS layer in order to let him do that.  Certainly there's nothing at the filesystem structure layer preventing circular directory references.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1322059929","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c325i54","link_id":"t3_mmfox","name":"t1_c325i54","parent_id":"t1_c324vqi","retrieved_on":1427919196,"score":13,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"xkcd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0z","ups":13,"month":11}

{"archived":true,"author":"GMTao","body":"I suspect that rhetoric like this, while justified, is one of the reasons Play was selected for Typesafe's stack instead of David's Lift framework.  I love Lift, I think the design is great.  But I also help design APIs for a living, and I know how much of a pain binary compatibility can become.  Sun's model was originally sound, namely deprecate the code and remove it.  It's easier said than done however.\n\nMy suggestion for the Scala masters would be as follows:\n\n1. Stop breaking binary compatibility between every releases.  If you are going to break something, do it at a major release point, i.e. 3.0, 4.0, etc.\n\n2. Deprecate **only** when you have a replacement, and then keep the deprecated method for 2-3 minor releases, i.e. deprecate in 2.7.x but remove in 2.9.x.  Bug-fix releases (at least that's how I refer to them, namely the 3rd number in the version number) don't count.\n\n3. Try to do better than offering a tool that checks for binary compatibility.  It's a great start, but not perfect by a long shot.  Stability in the core libraries is what is needed, so David's point here is sound.\n\nAs for David's rant, he often goes to paint himself as one of the original people who started using Scala outside of Martin himself.  That's great, and I don't mean to belittle him at all.  I've used Scala for roughly a year now, so I don't claim to know nearly as much as he does.  David is likely right when he says things like he's written more Scala code than anyone else in the world.  Yet complaining publicly in a blog isn't going to help anything.  Maybe he has spoken with the Typesafe guys about this, I honestly don't know and I don't want to hazard guess.  However something about this plea just seems wrong; it seems more like whining and asking for others to back his opinion rather than trying to offer suggestions on how to fix the problem.  Typesafe seems to be hiring, perhaps he may want to consider working with them on the inside to instigate change.  But again given that Typesafe went with Play, I can't see that happening.\n\nAs an aside, I haven't worked with Play myself, but I can understand the reasoning behind Typesafe's decision to use it.  Namely if you want to get someone who's using RoR or Django for their web app (hell, even JSF) then Play is a natural stepping stone.  Lift needs some forethought and a whole lot of thinking things through in a different way.  Scala is enough of a challenge for those coming from these other languages and frameworks, combining that with Lift will likely lead to frustration and abandonment.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1323319595","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c365ny1","link_id":"t3_n44iq","name":"t1_c365ny1","parent_id":"t3_n44iq","retrieved_on":1427988490,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"scala","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh37","ups":10,"month":12}

So why do we see a change in the universe's thickness \"as we go forward over our time axis\" (ala the \"horn\").  What is causing variance over time?  \n\nAlso, in the first place, why is the mass at the center of the universe shrinking the rest of the universe?  It is an \"odd effect\" as you say, but is there some reason to expect this?  I can't come up with an intuitive way to imagine it.  Contrast this with the rubber sheet example, the whole point of which is to provide an intuitive (if incomplete) way of thinking about space as a \"malleable\" 3-D thing, just like rubber is a malleable 2-D thing.\n\nLastly, one nit-picky thing:\n\n\"...the lives and journeys of any point creatures which live in this universe will be represented by infinitely long threads...\"  Presumably you mean \"finite threads\"?

I figured if you could calculate every trillionth of a nanosecond or something you'd get heaps of interest.
